Lesson 3 Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When sharing files or collaborating with others.
- If you want to access remotely from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- There may be changes which you are not yet ready to share with collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branches only exist in local repository, use them to manage files on the local machine
- Clones operate on local and remote repositories, use them to collaborate or set up a second distinct local repository.
- Forks are available on github to allow users to take a copy of a repository that they don't have write access too.
