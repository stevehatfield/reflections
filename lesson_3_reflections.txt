Lesson 3 Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When sharing files or collaborating with others.
- If you want to access remotely from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- There may be changes which you are not yet ready to share with collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branches only exist in local repository, use them to manage files on the local machine
- Clones operate on local and remote repositories, use them to collaborate or set up a second distinct local repository.
- Forks are available on github to allow users to take a copy of a repository that they don't have write access too.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You can work on the remote whilst off-line and merge later (example given was on an aeroplane flight)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- It would be harder to maintain visibility of changes and also more likely that inconsistent versions would exist.
- Collaboration without github would probably require more work to synchronise file changes, possibly via email or other means.
- Version history would not be available.

- It would be easier without github if you were purely working locally.
