What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- git init sets up the additional metadata that git requires to version control the files within the repository. It will produce a message along the lines of:
"Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/stephenhatfield/Documents/Courses/udacity/How to Use Git and GitHub Videos/version-control/.git/"

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file.

- git status initially shows something like:
"On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	reflections/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)"
